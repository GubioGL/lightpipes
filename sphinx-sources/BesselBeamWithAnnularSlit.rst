Generation of a Bessel beam with a lens and an annular slit.
------------------------------------------------------------

By positioning an aperture around the disk a non-difracting Bessel beam is generated over a distance given by
the 'overlap area'. From geometric optics this distance can be estimated by:

:math:`z_{max}=\frac{Df}{a}`, where :math:`D` and :math:`f` are the diameter and focallength of the lens respectively.
