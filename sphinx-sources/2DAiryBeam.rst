Generation of a 2-dimensional Airy beam from a Gaussian laser beam.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A two-dimensional Airy beam can be generated by substituting a cubic phase 
distribution in a Gaussian beam followed by a Fourier transform by a positive lens.
In the simulation below we repeat the simulations published by 
Latychevskaia et al. [#a1]_ and we compare the LightPipes simulation with their results.
