Multi- holes and slits.
-----------------------

In this example we demonstrate the use of a number of holes or slits in a row.
In this way it is possible to make a grating. There are two wavelengths in the beam which demonstrates 
the use of a grating as a spectrometer. The intensities of the two fields can be simply added after separate propagations.

Below we demonstrate interference from a row of holes.
