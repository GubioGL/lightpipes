Non-diffractive Bessel beam.
****************************

A Bessel beam has the interesting property that it does not diffract and that it keeps its shape
over large distances. Several meters, depending on parameters, can be realized. Applications of Bessel beams
take advantage of the very large size of the focus, which cannot be obtained using lenses or mirrors.
For example generation of a long narrow plasma channel can be realized using a high-power
laser beam converted into a Bessel beam by an axicon lens.
 
Besides an axicon, a combination of an annular slit and a positive lens or concave mirror can be used in staed.
In the following example a Poisson spot is generated by illuminating a circular disk by a plane mono-chromatic beam.
The disk is positioned in the primary focus of a positive lens so that the waves originating from the edge of teh disk will be collimated.
By blocking the rest of the incoming beam only the edge waves remain which results in a 
non-diffracting Bessel beam.

Zernike aberration.
*******************

Any aberration in a circle can be decomposed over a sum of Zernike 
polynomials. The Zernike command accepts four arguments:
1. The radial order n  2. The 
azimuthal order m. 3. The radius, R 4. The 
amplitude of the aberration.
